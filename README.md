### Summary
This code was developed during my compulsory internship in my Computational Mathematics major. ItÂ´s a program that manages selling and creation of NFT tokens in a Blockchain enviroment.
For now, it is in "Stand-by" until I finish more projects.

### Changes that will be made
- Hardhat was used to build the project. However, my knowledge of TypeScript is limited, whereas my knowledge of Solidity is more developed. Therefore, I will migrate the project from Hardhat to Foundry. 
- Coding the tests needed to check that the code works correctly
- Refactoring
